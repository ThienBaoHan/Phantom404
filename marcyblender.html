            Hello guys. This is my first model I created in blender.
            To be honest, I was very suprised how simple it was to scuplt 
            a 3D model in Blender, I always thought such thing would take 
             many years to learn, but all it took was following one 
              hour tutorial long. (Many thanks to CG BOOST!) <br><br>

              &nbsp;  &nbsp; Of course I'm not saying that learning Blender is easy, 
              it takes years and constant learning to master the program,
               my point is just give it a shot and you'll see, it is not as
                intimidating as it seems to be.
        </p> <br>
        <h3 style="color: rgb(168, 204, 235); font-size: 24px;">About this Model</h3>
        <p style="font-family: consolas; font-size: 20px;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; As the name 
            suggested, this 3D model was based on Marceline Abadeer, 
            (aka The Vampire Queen), one of the main characters in Adventure Time. 
            Also the whole reason why I started learning Blender (You have no 
          idea how much I wanted Marceline in action with Arcane's art style!!).
          <br><br>
          &nbsp; &nbsp; Here is a a rough sketch of Marceline I made
          using Procreate. <br><br>
